## Project Overview

**Team Name:** Ctrl Alt Elite  
**Group Members:** Cole Arduser, Luke Farmer, Sam Loecke, Sam Nicklaus  
**Date:** 11/25/2023  

The Smart OBD Diagnostic System (SODS) is an innovative solution aimed at transforming the way car owners access and analyze vehicle data. By leveraging the OBD port, SODS provides real-time data visualization in the vehicle and extensive post-trip data analysis through a user-friendly web application. 

### Executive Summary

SODS addresses the challenge of accessing comprehensive, real-time vehicle diagnostics and detailed post-trip analyses. It features a physical dashboard for in-car live data display and a web application for thorough analysis and review of vehicle performance and health. The project's goal is to make informed vehicle maintenance and performance decisions accessible to all car owners.

### Problem Statement

In the current automotive landscape, there is a lack of comprehensive systems that provide real-time access to vehicle diagnostics and offer post-trip analytics. SODS aims to fill this gap by integrating a physical dashboard for live data and a web application for detailed analytics.

### Design Objectives

- Develop a data collection device for the vehicle's OBD 2 port.
- Create a database for storing in-operation data.
- Design a live-data dashboard for in-vehicle display.
- Develop a web application for post-trip data analysis.
- Establish a web server for seamless data communication.
